### Segment.com Integration
Segment is a service that allows single lines in your code to translate to multiple API calls to different services. If you're using Segment, we now have support built in – check out our [Segment setup guide](https://help.sendwithus.com/solution/articles/1000173550-segment-com-triggers) or the [Segment Sendwithus docs](https://segment.com/docs/integrations/sendwithus/) to get started – otherwise, you can start with the [introduction to Segment](https://segment.com/docs/).
